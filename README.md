# Introduction

This [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch) plugin provides a preview
command (âŒ˜P) that will export the currently selected Artboard and open the
resulting image file in [Skala Preview](http://bjango.com/mac/skalapreview). If
you prefer, you can name a slice `Preview`, and that slice will be used instead.

# Installation

Copy `Preview.jstalk` to the Sketch plugin directory. For Sketch 3, this
should be:

`~/Library/Containers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Data/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins`

If you're feeling brave, you can do something like this:

```
curl https://raw.github.com/marcisme/sketch-preview/master/Preview.jstalk \
    -o ~/Library/Containers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Data/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins/Preview.jstalk
```

If you're still using Sketch 2, your plugin directory should be either of the
following for App Store or direct download versions respectively.

* `~/Library/Containers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch/Data/Library/Application\ Support/sketch/Plugins`
* `~/Library/Application\ Support/sketch/plugins`

# Usage

* Make sure you have an Artboard selected

    or

* Create a device screen-sized slice, and name it `Preview`
