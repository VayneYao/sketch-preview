# Introduction

This [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch) plugin provides a preview
command (âŒ˜P) that will export the currently selected Artboard and open the
resulting image file in [Skala Preview](http://bjango.com/mac/skalapreview). If
you prefer, you can name a slice `Preview`, and that slice will be used instead.

# Installation

The easiest way to install the plugin is to
[download](https://github.com/marcisme/sketch-preview/archive/master.zip) the
latest version of this project and double-click the `Preview.sketchplugin` file.

## Manual Installation

You can also copy `Preview.sketchplugin` to the Sketch plugin directory
yourself. For Sketch 3, this should be:

```
~/Library/Containers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Data/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins
```

You can open this directory in the Finder with the `Plugins -> Reveal Plugins
Folder...` menu item. Alternatively if you're feeling brave, you can do
something like this:

```
curl https://raw.github.com/marcisme/sketch-preview/master/Preview.sketchplugin \
    -o ~/Library/Containers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Data/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins/Preview.sketchplugin
```

If you're still using Sketch 2, your plugin directory should be either of the
following for App Store or direct download versions respectively.

* `~/Library/Containers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch/Data/Library/Application\ Support/sketch/Plugins`
* `~/Library/Application\ Support/sketch/plugins`

# Usage

* Make sure you have an Artboard selected

    or

* Create a device screen-sized slice, and name it `Preview`

# Compatibility

This plugin has been used successfully with the following versions of software.
Not all combinations of each application have been tested, but this should give
you some idea of the latest versions that have worked for other people. Feel
free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/marcisme/sketch-preview/compare/)
if you've used the plugin with a newer version of any of these applications.

* Sketch 2.4.4 (5370)
* Sketch 3.0.1 (7597)
* Skala Preview 1.6.0
* Skala View for Andriod 1.2.2

# Troubleshooting

Some people have reported problems with the currently selected Artboard not
being recognized as selected. I've noticed that in Sketch 2, you may have to
select one of the layers within an Artboard as opposed to the Artboard itself.
This does not seem to be an issue in Sketch 3.

If you find any other issues, you can try to reproduce them with
`PreviewTest.sketch`, found in the test directory of this repository. You can
also edit the plugin file to set `DEBUG` to `true` and look at the output in
`Console.app` to get a better idea of what is going on. Please open an
[issue](https://github.com/marcisme/sketch-preview/issues/new) if there is still
a problem.
